## Project Description

* Work with data to understand the characteristics of a diamond which are most likely to influence its price.

* Rick ‚Äì *our client* ‚Äì has 5,000 diamonds and asked us to estimate their price based on a historic dataset with over 54,000 diamond prices.

## Metrics

**The metric of success is, of course, money** üí≤üí∞üí≤üí∞üí≤

* Our assignment is to estimate the price of Rick‚Äôs 5,000 diamonds achieving the smallest amount of error, so he can sell them properly.

* We will specifically measure the **root mean squared error (RMSE)** of our predictions.

* Rick‚Äôs goal is to obtain an average error **below 900 dollars**.

## Conclusion

The price of a diamond has a direct correlation with its carat. It is not a straight linear correlation but an exponential one. There are other relevant features which also influence its price, such as color, clarity and cut.

* Diamonds Analysis 01
   - Our first approach was to predict the price applying a separate regression model for each color grade with carat weight, clarity grade and cut grade as independent variables. With this method we achieved a root **mean squared error (RMSE)** result of **979.66** USD, almost beating the goal. `File: Diamonds_Analysis_01_A.ipynb`
   - Then we improved the model with clustering to create a new variable based on the diamond's carat weight: either belonging to the first 3 quartiles or not. We got a slightly better result with a **RMSE** of **967.38** USD. `File: Diamonds_Analysis_01_B.ipynb`

* Diamonds Analysis 02
   - On our second approach we switched the way we used color and clarity, creating a regression model for each clarity grade, with color as an independent variable along with carat and cut. With this second approach we got our best **RMSE** result of **791.55** USD. `File: Diamonds_Analysis_02_A.ipynb`
   - Then we tried the same strategy used before but the results were worsened, reaching a **RMSE** of **1,213.73** USD. `File: Diamonds_Analysis_02_B.ipynb`

We did not try the approach of using a different regression model for each cut grade because the graphic analysis of the scatterplot showed a more spread out distribution than the clarity and color ones.

**We conclude that the order of the 4Cs which most influences diamond prices is:**
   1. **Carat**
   2. **Clarity**
   3. **Color**
   4. **Cut**

```

Note: we always got lower values calculating the RMSE with the historic data compared to the
Rick's dataset because the model is biased with its own original data.
